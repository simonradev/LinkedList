# LinkedList

This is a dynamic list which means that it doesn't store the elements in the traditional way (in an array). Every single element 
holds it's value and a reference to the next element. The list knows only its first element (the head) and it holds a reference to 
the next one which holds reference to the next one and so on.

These are the implemented properties:
- Count;
- [int index] - you can get an element by index.

These are the implemented methods:
- Add();
- AddRange();
- InsertAt();
- InsertRange();
- Remove();
- RemoveAt();
- RemoveRange();
- ElementAt();
- IndexOf();
- GetAllElements();
- overriden ToString();
